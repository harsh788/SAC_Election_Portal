## Abstract
Voting is a very important part of our lives. Voting enables us to make basic decisions that affect our lives. Voting is an integral part of a democratic society. In our college particularly, voting is involved for selecting members for SAC. Students need to physically  go to designated voting locations in order to cast their vote. This can lead to lesser accessibility and in turn lesser voting percentage. On the other hand, online portals allow voters to participate from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need to travel to physical polling stations. This, in particular, is helpful for students who are not on campus during the voting period.

## Introduction

The SAC Elections Portal is a custom-built website that offers comprehensive information about ongoing elections, including details about participating candidates, eligible student voters, and the status of votes cast. This platform serves as a centralized hub for hosting SAC elections, providing students with the ability to conveniently cast their votes.

### Functionalities
- The homepage of the SAC Elections Portal showcases all presently ongoing elections, presenting diverse statistics like candidate count, voter participation, and registered vote counts. Live standings for each election are also available, providing up-to-the-minute updates. Additionally, a convenient button is included to facilitate the process of adding a new vote.
- Each election comprises a dynamic list featuring eligible student voters and the candidates vying for positions within that specific election. This list is continually updated, allowing for the addition or removal of new participants as necessary.
- To cast a vote in an election, users are required to input their roll number and select their preferred candidate from a list provided. Upon submission, the backend system verifies the user’s roll number to ensure its validity before registering their vote. This verification process
ensures that only eligible users can successfully cast their votes.
- The ”All Participants” page exhibits a comprehensive list encompassing both students and candidates across all ongoing elections. This centralized platform enables users to add new students or candidates and delete existing entries, providing efficient management capabilities
for participants across multiple elections.
- A dedicated page exists to display the comprehensive list of all votes registered to date. Users are granted the option to edit their votes should they reconsider their choice of candidate, allowing for the selection of an alternate candidate in case of a change of preference.

## What is DevOps
DevOps represents a transformative approach to software development and IT operations, driven by collaboration, automation, and cultural alignment. It’s a philosophy that fosters a harmonious relationship between traditionally separate development and operations teams, promoting shared
goals and responsibilities throughout the software delivery life cycle. By breaking down silos and encouraging open communication, DevOps aims to streamline processes, increase agility, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software. This approach prioritizes automation, employing
tools and practices to automate repetitive tasks.

## Software Development Life Cycle
### Installations
#### Node.js
Choosing NodeJS for the backend of the project was driven by the aim to maintain language consistency across both the frontend and backend components. NodeJS, with its JavaScript-based runtime, enables developers to use the same language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side scripting.

To install NodeJS on your system:
- Open the terminal and enter the command `sudo apt install nodejs`
- Verify the installation using `node --version`
- For this project, we need to install a node package manager. Run the command `sudo apt install npm`

#### MongoDB
To install MongoDB on your system:
- Run the command `sudo apt install -y mongodb`
- To start MongoDB service, run `sudo systemctl start mongodb`
- To stop MongoDB service, run `sudo systemctl stop mongodb`

### Version Control System
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, enabling multiple contributors to collaborate on a project by managing different versions of files, facilitating collaboration, and providing the ability to revert to previous states or branches. For our project, we have used Git as our version control system.
#### CI Pipeline
Start Jenkins from terminal and open the url localhost:8080 in your browser. Create a new project. To make jenkins clone your git repository, add the following script.
```
pipeline {
    environment {
        docker_image=""
    }
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Stage 1: Git Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/harsh788/SAC_Election_Portal.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Docker
Docker is a platform that simplifies the deployment and management of applications by using containers—lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that package applications and their
dependencies, allowing them to run consistently across different environments. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure complexities, enabling easier development, testing, and deployment
of software.
We will use Docker for building docker images by making use of the Dockerfile. Dockerfile will contain steps to pull a base image from DockerHub, installing the dependencies mentioned in package.json file by running the command npm install, copying the source code, building and
packaging the react app source code using the command npm run build, etc.
#### CI Pipeline
To automate the process of creating Docker images of backend and frontend folders with jenkins, we will add the following script in the pipeline:
```
stage('Stage 2: Build Docker Image'){
    steps{
        dir('backend')
        {
            script{
                docker_image = docker.build "harsh788/backend_image:latest"
            }
        }
        dir('frontend')
        {
            script{
                docker_image = docker.build "harsh788/frontend_image:latest"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To create a mongodb container for our database, we first need to build an image for it. Pull the official base version of mongo image from DockerHub. This step needs to be performed before creating frontend and backend images because the containers of these iamges will depend on mongodb container. Add the following code at the top of the Jenkins pipeline:
```
stage('Stage 0: Pull mongo docker image')
{
    steps{
        script{
            sh 'docker rm -f mongo_container frontend_container backend_container'
            docker.withRegistry('', 'DockerHubCred') {
                docker.image('mongo').pull()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We will also push these newly created docker images to DockerHub so that anyone can pull them and use it in their own systems. To do so, add the following stage in the pipeline:
```
stage('Stage 3: Push docker image to hub') {
    steps{
        script{
            docker.withRegistry('', 'DockerHubCred'){
                // docker_image.push()
                sh 'docker push harsh788/frontend_image:latest'
                sh 'docker push harsh788/backend_image:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Once you run this pipeline multiple times, you will notice duplicate instances of docker images getting created every time. These are nothing but older versions of the docker images which are no longer useful. To remove these from our system, we can create another pipleine stage as follows:
```
stage('Stage 4: Clean docker images'){
    steps{
        script{
            sh 'docker container prune -f'
            sh 'docker image prune -f'
        }   
    }
}
```

### Docker-Compose
As one might have noticed till now, we are working with multiple docker containers, one for the database and one for each of frontend and backend. To manage all of their activities, like starting or stoping multiple containers at once, we make of the docker-compose file. It is a yaml file which contains instructions to build docker containers from images on specified ports, and to allow them to communicate with each other over a shared network. Communication between these containers is a must, as frontend container will send api requests to the backend container, which in turn will query the database container before sending a response. To achieve data persistance in our mongodb container, we make use of volumes. Volumes are a feature that allows containers to persist and manage data beyond the container’s life cycle.

### Deployment-Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It simplifies complex tasks by allowing the automation of repetitive system administration tasks across multiple servers, streamlining infrastructure management through a declarative language and agentless architecture, making it popular for IT automation and DevOps practices.

Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as inventory. Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.

Playbooks contain the steps which the user wants to execute on a particular machine. Playbooks are run sequentially. Playbooks are the building blocks for all the use cases of Ansible.

The complete workflow for Ansible goes like this:
- **Initialization**: Ansible reads the inventory file to identify the target hosts for deployment.
- **Execution**: The deploy.yml files contains the following tasks: Copying the docker-compose file to remote host, pulling the images mentioned in it, running the docker-compose file which will start the three containers.

#### CI Pipeline
To add the above mentioned tasks in jenkins for automation, we update the jenkins pipeline by adding the following stage:
```
stage('Stage 5: Ansible Deployment'){
    steps{
        ansiblePlaybook becomeUser: null,
        colorized: true,
        credentialsId: 'localhost',
        disableHostKeyChecking: true,
        installation: 'Ansible',
        inventory: 'deployment/inventory',
        playbook: 'deployment/deploy.yml',
        sudoUser: null
    }
}
```

### Continuous Monitoring
Continuous monitoring is a practice of consistently observing and analyzing systems, applications, and networks to detect and respond to potential issues or threats in real-time. It involves gathering metrics, logs, and other relevant data to gain insights into the health, performance, and security of an environment, ensuring continuous availability and reliability. Various log messages have been included in the project. On execution, these logs will be added to a file in the container. We need to extract this file. We can do so by running the command: \texttt{sudo docker cp backend\_container:/app/combined.log /your\_path}. Once we have the log file, we can upload it to Kibana. To do so, we need to start the Elasticsearch and Kibana service. Run the following commands:
- `sudo systemctl start elasticsearch`
- `sudo systemctl start kibana`

### Testing
The goal is to ensure that each unit of code behaves as expected and to catch any potential bugs or issues early in the development process. Unit testing in backend JavaScript involves testing individual units of code, typically functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the application.
Framework used:
- **Mocha**: Mocha is a flexible and feature-rich test framework that provides a structure for organizing and running tests.
- **Chai**: Chai is an assertion library that works seamlessly with Mocha (and other test frameworks). It provides a set of expressive and chainable APIs for making assertions about the behavior of code.

#### CI Pipeline
```
stage('Stage 6: Testing Backend') {
    steps {
        dir('backend') {
            script {
                // Assuming npm is available in the container
                sh 'npm install' // Install dependencies if needed
                sh 'npm test'    // Run the tests
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Steps to run
Install the node_modules folders in frontend and backend directories using `npm install`

To spin up the containers and run locally: `sudo docker compose up` \
To stop the running containers and delete them: `sudo docker compose down`

## API Documentation
### Schemas
There are four schemas used in this project. They are as follows:
- **Student**: It contains three fields: name, roll number, batch
- **Candidate**: It contains five fields: first name, last name, roll number, batch, message
- **Vote**: It contains three fields: voter, timestamp, selection
- **Election**: It contains four fields: title, voter list, votes, candidates

### Endpoints
The various API endpoints exposed by the server, and where the frontend can make a fetch request are as follows:
- **HomePage**: http://localhost:5000/ or http://lcoalhost:5000/dashboard [GET]
- **Casting a vote to an election**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/election/:id [GET POST]
- **List of all students**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/students [GET]
- **Adding a new student**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/student/create [GET POST]
- **Deleting a student**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/student/:id/delete [GET
POST]
- **List of all candidates**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/candidates [GET]
- **Adding a new candidate**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/candidate/create [GET POST]
- **Deleting a candidate**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/candidate/:id/delete
[GET POST]
- **List of all votes**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/votes [GET]
- **Updating an existing vote**: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/vote/:id/update [GET POST]

## Future Work
- **User Authorization**: Currently there are no roles assigned to a user. Any user can perform any operation. A role based mechanism can be implemented with exclusive rights to admin.
- **User Authentication**: When separate roles are assigned to users, there needs to be an authentication mechanism so as to validate users with the help of username and password.
- **Add more CRUD operations**: Election Create, Update, Delete; Student Update; Candidate Update; Vote Delete operations are yet to be implemented.
